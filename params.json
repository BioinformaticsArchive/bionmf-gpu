{"name":"NMF-mGPU","tagline":"NMF-mGPU: Non-negative Matrix Factorization on multi-GPU Systems","body":"# NMF-mGPU is an efficient and easy-to-use implementation of the Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) algorithm, that takes advantage of the high computing performance delivered by Graphics-Processing Units (GPUs). NMF takes an input matrix (V) and returns two matrices, W and H, whose product is equal to the former (i.e., V ~ W * H). If V has \"n\" rows and \"m\" columns, then dimensions for W and H, will be 'n-by-k' and 'k-by-m', respectively. The \"factorization rank\" (\"k\") specified by the user, is usually a value much less than both, \"n\" and \"m\".\n\nNMF-mGPU is based on CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture), the NVIDIA's framework for GPU computing. On devices with low memory available, large input matrices are blockwise transferred from the system's main memory to the GPU's memory, and processed accordingly. In addition, NMF-mGPU has been explicitly optimized for the different CUDA architectures. Finally, platforms with multiple GPUs can be synchronized through MPI (Message Passing Interface).\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
